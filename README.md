## üìå Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a critical step in the **UI/UX design process**. It represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, allowing designers and developers to visualize the layout, navigation flow, and functionality before diving into full-scale development.

By stripping away colors, fonts, and other stylistic details, wireframes focus purely on **structure and usability**, ensuring that user needs are met from the very beginning. This practice minimizes risks, improves collaboration, and saves time during the development lifecycle.
